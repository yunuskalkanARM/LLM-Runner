description: Configure, build, and run CTest for this repository using CMake presets (native, x-android-aarch64, x-linux-aarch64), including common cache flags (LLM_FRAMEWORK, BUILD_JNI_LIB, USE_KLEIDIAI, BUILD_BENCHMARK, CPU_ARCH) and failure triage steps. Use when asked to run tests, reproduce build/CI failures, or diagnose CMake/CTest/JNI issues for this project.

# Build and test (CMake + CTest)

This is the default “prove it works” workflow for changes in this repo. Run it before wrapping up modifications to C++/CMake/tests (unless you explicitly agree to skip validation).

Windows note: if `python3` isn’t available, use `python` (or `py -3`) for the scripts below.

## Offline/build caveat

During configure, CMake may use FetchContent to download dependencies from the network. If your network is blocked, configure can fail before tests run. To enable network access when the process runs in a sandbox, see `skills/README.md`. Otherwise, run the build on your local machine (with network access) and share the resulting build path with the tool (for example: `build dir: /path/to/build`), or point CMake at pre-downloaded dependencies in your environment.

## Workflow

### 1) Configure (preset + optional flags)

Use one of the repo presets in `CMakePresets.json`:

```sh
cmake --preset=native -B build
```

Common configuration flags:

```sh
# Select backend
cmake --preset=native -B build -DLLM_FRAMEWORK=llama.cpp
cmake --preset=native -B build -DLLM_FRAMEWORK=onnxruntime-genai
cmake --preset=native -B build -DLLM_FRAMEWORK=mediapipe
cmake --preset=native -B build -DLLM_FRAMEWORK=mnn
```

```sh
# Disable JNI (faster iteration; avoids requiring JDK)
cmake --preset=native -B build -DBUILD_JNI_LIB=OFF
```

```sh
# Disable KleidiAI optimizations (for A/B testing)
cmake --preset=native -B build -DUSE_KLEIDIAI=OFF
```

```sh
# AArch64 ISA selection (llama.cpp + linux-aarch64 target only)
cmake --preset=native -B build -DCPU_ARCH=Armv8.2_4
```

### 2) Build

```sh
cmake --build ./build --parallel
```

### 3) Run tests (CTest)

```sh
ctest --test-dir ./build --output-on-failure
```

Run verbose and/or a subset:

```sh
ctest --test-dir ./build -V
ctest --test-dir ./build -N
ctest --test-dir ./build -R llm-cpp-ctest -V
```

### 4) Diagnose common failures

- Handle downloads: configure runs a downloads step (`scripts/cmake/download-resources.cmake` → `scripts/py/download_resources.py`); set `HF_TOKEN` (or `~/.netrc` for `huggingface.co`) for gated models.
- Check logs: read `build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log` and `build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log`.
- Isolate JNI: retry with `-DBUILD_JNI_LIB=OFF` to separate C++ failures from Java/JNI toolchain issues.
- Confirm cache: inspect `build/CMakeCache.txt` for `LLM_FRAMEWORK`, `BUILD_JNI_LIB`, `USE_KLEIDIAI`, `CPU_ARCH`.

## Optional automation

Run the bundled helper script:

```sh
python3 skills/llm-build-and-ctest/scripts/run_build_and_ctest.py native build
```

For deeper triage patterns, load `skills/llm-build-and-ctest/references/ctest-triage.md`.
