# Output validation & test alignment (new models)

This repo’s tests currently validate outputs using substring checks on a few “anchor” facts (e.g., `"Paris"` for a capital-city question, or `"tiger"` for an image label). New models can change phrasing, casing, or add extra text; update tests without making them meaningless.

## Preferred strategy (in order)

1) **Constrain the prompt** to reduce variation
- “Answer with a single word.”
- “Reply with only the country name.”
- “Describe in 1 short sentence.”

2) **Check for a stable anchor**
- Names/entities are better than full sentences.
- Accept a small set of alternatives when real (e.g., `["dog", "puppy"]` already used in `test/cpp/LlmTest.cpp`).

3) **Normalize before checking (when needed)**
- Use case-insensitive matching by lowercasing the response and expected tokens.
- Avoid punctuation/whitespace sensitivity.

4) **Only then broaden acceptance**
- Regex/keyword sets can be OK, but keep them tight.
- Avoid “non-empty output” checks unless you’re explicitly testing liveness/progress.

## When it is OK to revise expected outputs

- The new model is correct but uses a different valid synonym or casing.
- The prompt/template changes for a backend (chat templates, stop words) change the output shape.
- The model adds harmless boilerplate (e.g., “The capital is Paris.”) and your assertion was too strict.

## When it is NOT OK to revise expected outputs

- The model is wrong (hallucination, incorrect entity).
- The model is failing to follow modality constraints (vision model not recognizing obvious objects).
- The output indicates it didn’t load the model correctly (empty, repeated tokens, errors).

## Practical “proof” loop for a new model

- Add config + model assets.
- Run the config-specific ctest (find it via `ctest --test-dir ./build -N` then run with `-R <name> -V`).
- If failures are output-drift only:
  - tighten prompts and/or extend the small expected-token allowlist
  - rerun and ensure the test still fails under an intentionally broken condition (wrong model path, wrong image, etc.)

## Offline/build caveat

During configure, CMake may use FetchContent to download dependencies from the network. If your network is blocked, configure will fail before tests run. To enable network access when the process runs in a sandbox, see `skills/README.md`. Otherwise, run the build outside the tool (with network access), or point CMake at a pre-downloaded dependency in your environment.
